## Naming

You will probably see other names throughout the project... they are all equally correct and incorrect.

## Tech

Currently running electron + vite + typescript.

## Troubleshooting

- If you're working on multithreading via web workers and your changes are not reflected, you might need to run `npm build` or `npm start` to force it to build once.
